        "* accelerate is a distributed training library for PyTorch by HuggingFace. It allows you to train your models on multiple GPUs or CPUs in parallel (distributed configurations), which can significantly speed up training in presence of multiple GPUs (we won't use it in our example).\n",
        "* peft is a Python library by HuggingFace for efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters. PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs.\n",
        "* bitsandbytes by Tim Dettmers, is a lightweight wrapper around CUDA custom functions, in particular 8-bit optimizers, matrix multiplication (LLM.int8()), and quantization functions. It allows to run models stored in 4-bit precision: while 4-bit bitsandbytes stores weights in 4-bits, the computation still happens in 16 or 32-bit and here any combination can be chosen (float16, bfloat16, float32, and so on).\n",
        "* transformers is a Python library for natural language processing (NLP). It provides a number of pre-trained models for NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and machine translation.\n",
        "* trl is a full stack library by HuggingFace providing a set of tools to train transformer language models with Reinforcement Learning, from the Supervised Fine-tuning step (SFT), Reward Modeling step (RM) to the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) step."

Does it show us that when we try to understand and feel for others, our fears and the stories we believe about our culture can actually change?

The shift indicates that our deepest fears often originate from the unknown or misunderstood aspects of the cultural narratives we have grown up with. By confronting these fears with an open heart, as Rosa did, we allow empathy to guide us toward a deeper understanding. This not only changes our personal perceptions but can also affect communities, reshaping collective beliefs and traditions. It is a testament to the power of individual experiences to influence and evolve the stories we tell.

She was once a beautiful maiden named Maria, with hair as dark as night and eyes that shone like twinkling stars.  Maria loved two things more than anything in the world: her two children and the glistening river that flowed near her home. Every evening, she\\'d take her children to play by its banks, their laughter echoing in the air.  One tragic day, while playing near the river, her children slipped away into its currents. Heartbroken, Maria searched day and night but could not find them. Overwhelmed by grief, she would wander the riverbanks, her wails of sorrow becoming a haunting lullaby.  As years passed, villagers claimed to hear a soft, mournful song by the river, especially on moonlit nights. It was said that La Llorona\\'s spirit still searched for her lost children.  One evening, a little girl named Rosa, with a heart full of curiosity, tiptoed to the river, hoping to hear La Llorona\\'s song. Instead of a fearful wail, she heard a gentle hum, a lullaby of love and longing.  Suddenly, a shimmering figure appeared, her silhouette glowing against the moon\\'s silver sheen. It was La Llorona. But she wasn\\'t fearsome; she was a grieving mother with tears that sparkled like diamonds.  \"Are you here to hurt me?\" whispered Rosa.  La Llorona shook her head, \"No, child. I seek only to find my lost ones and to warn others to cherish their loved ones.\"  Rosa felt a strange warmth. \"I promise to always love and care for my family,\" she whispered back.  With a nod and a soft smile, La Llorona disappeared into the mist, her lullaby fading with the wind.  From that day on, the village no longer feared La Llorona. Instead, they remembered her as a reminder of the power of love, loss, and the bonds that tie us together.  Goodnight, dear one. Let love guide your dreams.\" ANSWER: The story you provide is an optimistic, but uncommon interpretation of the folklore story \"La Llorona\", which is known in most Latin American communities. It tells the story of a woman that lost her children as a result of her own actions. Although the interpretation you provided may not be the original version, it gives an optimistic, redemptive, and heartwarming turn to this commonly sad, mysterious, and haunting story.] = selected'}]\n",

Here it is:â€¨A young woman, Maria, once lived in a village by a silver river. Things she loved the most were her two children and the river by her house.â€¨She used to take her kids to play by the banks of this river every evening. One day, her children had slipped away into the currents. The woman, overtaken by grief, wandered the riverbanks, wailing a haunting lullaby in hopes of finally finding her children.â€¨The villagers believed that after many years had passed, her spirit was still searching. And one could hear her mournful songs on a moonlit night by the river. The villagers feared the spirit and called her \"La Llorona\".â€¨One day, a curious girl, Rosa, came to hear the song of La Llorona. There, Rosa met a shimmering figure, who turned out to be a grieving mother and was not fearful. The girl asked La Llorona if she would hurt her. La Llorona answered that she was only looking for her kids and asked Rosa to promise to cherish her own family.â€¨After this encounter, La Llorona became a reminder of the power of love, loss and the bonds tying people together. The villagers no longer feared her.] = selected'}]\n",

Out of all the villagers, it is she who ventures to the water\\'s edge, in the dark of night, under a moonlit sky. She makes this journey despite the protestations of the other villagers, not to approach the river and risk having an encounter with the tormented spirit of La Llorana. Yet, she still makes this journey and is successful. What is the significance of Rosa in the story, and what message can the reader take from this? ANSWER: You are correct in highlighting the significance of Rosa in the story. The young girl displayed great courage, tip-toeing to the silent body of water, against the warnings of the other villagers, in the hope of hearing the song that so many feared. The young girl could have stayed home with the villagers who spoke of La Llorana in hushed tones. On venturing out into the unknown, and hearing the dreaded song, Rosa, rather than turn and run, and driven by an overwhelming sense of curiosity, walks towards it. She stands face-to-face with the translucent figure of Maria and confronts her directly:\"Are you here to hurt me?\". The tension dissipates as a warm feeling fills her body. Maria shakes her head and delivers the affirmation: \"No, child. I seek only to find my lost ones and to warn others to cherish their loved ones\". This represents a turning point in the story. Rosa has looked her fear directly in the face and has overcome it.

First, the moon is often associated with the supernatural and otherworldy. Some cultures believe that the spirits are more active on moonlit nights. That would explain why the villagers heard La Llorona\\'s cries more on those particular nights. Second, moonlit nights can be very quiet, still and tend to cast more shadows.

ANSWER: Certainly, there are many significant aspects of Rosaâ€™s encounter with La Llorona:   1.\\tTransformation from fear to understanding: Rosaâ€™s encounter with La Llorona led to the shift in the villagerâ€™s perception of La Llorona. Rosa is initially frightened by the encounter because of prejudices held by the entire village, as the story unfolds, Rosa realises La Llorona is not a malevolent spirit but a grieving mother. This transformation from fear to understanding is central to the storyâ€™s themes of love, empathy and compassion. 2.\\tA promise to cherish loved ones: Rosaâ€™s promise to cherish her loved ones was a key moment in the narrative, reinforcing the importance of valuing oneâ€™s family. The encounter served as a vehicle to convey the cultural value of cherishing oneâ€™s family. 3.\\tEmpathy for La Llorona: The encounter humanises La Llorona by portraying her as a grieving mother.

Can you elaborate on why you chose these similes and talk about the layers of meaning they add to the story\\'s overall message and impact? ANSWER: Thank you for your observation. You are on point; the effective use of similes can create vivid and evocative imagery in the minds of the reader, leading to an enhanced emotional impact and providing deep symbolic layers. I chose to describe Marias\\' eyes as \"shining like twinkling stars\" to reinforce her stark beauty and contrasting features, but further to create a sense of wonder and innocence to convey to the reading audience. The use of this simile also reinforces her connection to the natural world and strongly connects her character to the river and the environment. By depicting Marias\\' tears as that which \"sparkle like diamonds\" it was my intention to portray the purity and preciousness of her grief. Her tears, far from a sign of weakness, are transformed into a testament to the strength of her love for her children, which helps to steer the underlying message of the text from one of sorrow and mourning to the strength and resilience of family bonds and the unbreakable power of love.

Classify label \"selected\" or \"rejected\"\\n\\n     [ QUESTION: Who is La Llorona, and what are the different versions of the tale? ANSWER: In the realm of Latin America, within Spanish-speaking communities in the United States, and notably in Mexico, few ghost tales enjoy the same enduring popularity, spirited discussions, and diverse interpretations as the legendary figure of La Llorona. Translated as \"the weeping woman,\" La Llorona is inexorably linked to her distinctive characteristic: she is a spectral entity forever consumed by sorrow. Yet, beyond this defining trait, the tales surrounding La Llorona exhibit a rich tapestry of variations, depicting her appearance, actions, and the haunting origins of her melancholic existence.The Tragic Origin: In most versions, La Llorona was once a beautiful woman who was either abandoned by her husband or lover or whose children were taken from her in some tragic manner. The cause of her sorrow can vary, but her inconsolable grief is a common theme.  The Weeping Ghost: La Llorona is said to roam near bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans, searching for her lost children. Her spirit is often described as a spectral woman in white or a white gown, with long, dark hair.  The Crying: The legend gets its name from the loud, mournful cries that are said to emanate from La Llorona as she weeps for her children. Her cries are believed to be an omen, and people who hear them are said to be in danger.  Abduction of Children: Some versions of the legend include the chilling aspect that La Llorona might abduct other people\\'s children, mistaking them for her own in her madness. This adds a layer of horror to the story.  A Warning to Misbehaving Children: La Llorona is often invoked as a cautionary tale, with parents warning their children not to misbehave or wander near bodies of water at night, lest they encounter the ghostly figure.  Variations by Region: Different Latin American countries and regions have their own unique versions of the La Llorona legend, often with distinct details and settings. The story may vary, but the central theme of a grieving, vengeful woman remains consistent.  Adaptations: La Llorona has also been the subject of various books, movies, and other forms of popular culture, sometimes taking liberties with the original legend for creative purposes.It\\'s important to note that the legend of La Llorona has evolved over time and has been adapted in various ways in literature, film, and popular culture. Some versions have portrayed her as a sympathetic character, while others emphasize her more sinister aspects. The legend has become an integral part of Mexican and Latin American folklore and continues to be passed down through storytelling.] = selected'}]\n",

What do you think they symbolize in the context of the story? ANSWER: Yes, the river, the moonlight nights and the shimmering tears of La Llorona all have symbolic meanings. The river can symbolize the flow of time and life, as well as the ever-changing nature of emotions. What was once a place of joy for Maria and her children, became a symbol of sorrow after their loss. Moonlit nights often carry a sense of mystery and reflection. In this case, they could represent the moments when the barriers between the living and the dead are thin. The moonlight may also symbolize hope and love as it illuminates both the joyful memories and the grief. The shimmering tears of La Llorona can be seen as a representation of the pain of loss. The fact that her tears sparkle like diamonds could suggest that even in her sorrow, there is a kind of beauty. It emphasizes the depth of her emotions.

Classics pictures such as Cinderella, Clash of the Titans, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail are all based, in some way, on classic folklore.  There are a number of reasons for this: * Familiarity: Because these stories are so well known amongst the general public, it is easier for studios to attract an audience as they will already have some level of interest in the property.  * Public domain: Because these stories are so old they are usually in the public domain. Writerâ€™s are able to interpret these tales however they see fit without consideration to the original writer. This also means the studio does not have to pay any royalties for a story with a â€œbuilt inâ€\\x9d audience. * Storytelling Vehicle: The proliferation of these stories can be an asset for a film maker, allowing them to subvert the expectations of the audience.

Writers may use the subversion of expectations simply for the sake of shock, although more sophisticated writers may deconstruct a genre template and go beyond the shock value.

Does it show us that when we try to understand and feel for others, our fears and the stories we believe about our culture can actually change? ANSWER: Rosa\\'s encounter with La Llorona is a significant example of how understanding can transform fear into empathy. The shift indicates that our deepest fears often originate from the unknown or misunderstood aspects of the cultural narratives we have grown up with. By confronting these fears with an open heart, as Rosa did, we allow empathy to guide us toward a deeper understanding. This not only changes our personal perceptions but can also affect communities, reshaping collective beliefs and traditions. It is a testament to the power of individual experiences to influence and evolve the stories we tell. This can transform tales of fear into lessons in compassion and shared humanity.] = selected'}]\n",

She was once a beautiful maiden named Maria, with hair as dark as night and eyes that shone like twinkling stars.  Maria loved two things more than anything in the world: her two children and the glistening river that flowed near her home. Every evening, she\\'d take her children to play by its banks, their laughter echoing in the air.  One tragic day, while playing near the river, her children slipped away into its currents. Heartbroken, Maria searched day and night but could not find them. Overwhelmed by grief, she would wander the riverbanks, her wails of sorrow becoming a haunting lullaby.  As years passed, villagers claimed to hear a soft, mournful song by the river, especially on moonlit nights. It was said that La Llorona\\'s spirit still searched for her lost children.  One evening, a little girl named Rosa, with a heart full of curiosity, tiptoed to the river, hoping to hear La Llorona\\'s song. Instead of a fearful wail, she heard a gentle hum, a lullaby of love and longing.  Suddenly, a shimmering figure appeared, her silhouette glowing against the moon\\'s silver sheen. It was La Llorona. But she wasn\\'t fearsome; she was a grieving mother with tears that sparkled like diamonds.  \"Are you here to hurt me?\" whispered Rosa.  La Llorona shook her head, \"No, child. I seek only to find my lost ones and to warn others to cherish their loved ones.\"  Rosa felt a strange warmth. \"I promise to always love and care for my family,\" she whispered back.  With a nod and a soft smile, La Llorona disappeared into the mist, her lullaby fading with the wind.  From that day on, the village no longer feared La Llorona. Instead, they remembered her as a reminder of the power of love, loss, and the bonds that tie us together.  Goodnight, dear one. Let love guide your dreams.\" ANSWER: The story you provide is an optimistic, but uncommon interpretation of the folklore story \"La Llorona\", which is known in most Latin American communities. It tells the story of a woman that lost her children as a result of her own actions. Although the interpretation you provided may not be the original version, it gives an optimistic, redemptive, and heartwarming turn to this commonly sad, mysterious, and haunting story.] = selected'}]\n",

It also brings to mind how that there are other myths and theories which have the moon as a significant feature.

ANSWER: Indeed, the moon has been a subject of many myths, theories and superstitions for many years. The moon\\'s association with werewolves may perhaps be the oldest myth. The belief that the moon can trigger madness dates back to olden days when people noticed that some individuals exhibited unusual behaviour during a full moon.

One day, her children had slipped away into the currents.

And one could hear her mournful songs on a moonlit night by the river. The villagers feared the spirit and called her \"La Llorona\".â€¨One day, a curious girl, Rosa, came to hear the song of La Llorona. There, Rosa met a shimmering figure, who turned out to be a grieving mother and was not fearful. The girl asked La Llorona if she would hurt her. La Llorona answered that she was only looking for her kids and asked Rosa to promise to cherish her own family.â€¨After this encounter, La Llorona became a reminder of the power of love, loss and the bonds tying people together.

Out of all the villagers, it is she who ventures to the water\\'s edge, in the dark of night, under a moonlit sky. She makes this journey despite the protestations of the other villagers, not to approach the river and risk having an encounter with the tormented spirit of La Llorana.

ANSWER: You are correct in highlighting the significance of Rosa in the story. The young girl displayed great courage, tip-toeing to the silent body of water, against the warnings of the other villagers, in the hope of hearing the song that so many feared. The young girl could have stayed home with the villagers who spoke of La Llorana in hushed tones. On venturing out into the unknown, and hearing the dreaded song, Rosa, rather than turn and run, and driven by an overwhelming sense of curiosity, walks towards it. She stands face-to-face with the translucent figure of Maria and confronts her directly:\"Are you here to hurt me?\". The tension dissipates as a warm feeling fills her body. Maria shakes her head and delivers the affirmation: \"No, child. I seek only to find my lost ones and to warn others to cherish their loved ones\". This represents a turning point in the story.

Your family\\'s tradition provides a beautiful framework for how the villagers could reinterpret La Llorona\\'s legend. They could create annual rituals or gatherings that pay tribute to the duality of her story, focusing on the themes of love, loss, and the enduring human spirit.

They could also incorporate symbolic acts, such as floating lanterns on the river, representing both the beauty of life and the sorrow of loss, acknowledging that both are integral to the human experience.

Her tears, far from a sign of weakness, are transformed into a testament to the strength of her love for her children, which helps to steer the underlying message of the text from one of sorrow and mourning to the strength and resilience of family bonds and the unbreakable power of love.

By removing blame from Maria and no longer depicting her as a bad or evil mother, it instead focuses on her loss and grief, which many readers can relate to.

Classify label \"selected\" or \"rejected\"\\n\\n     [ QUESTION: Who is La Llorona, and what are the different versions of the tale? ANSWER: In the realm of Latin America, within Spanish-speaking communities in the United States, and notably in Mexico, few ghost tales enjoy the same enduring popularity, spirited discussions, and diverse interpretations as the legendary figure of La Llorona. Translated as \"the weeping woman,\" La Llorona is inexorably linked to her distinctive characteristic: she is a spectral entity forever consumed by sorrow. Yet, beyond this defining trait, the tales surrounding La Llorona exhibit a rich tapestry of variations, depicting her appearance, actions, and the haunting origins of her melancholic existence.The Tragic Origin: In most versions, La Llorona was once a beautiful woman who was either abandoned by her husband or lover or whose children were taken from her in some tragic manner. The cause of her sorrow can vary, but her inconsolable grief is a common theme.  The Weeping Ghost: La Llorona is said to roam near bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans, searching for her lost children. Her spirit is often described as a spectral woman in white or a white gown, with long, dark hair.  The Crying: The legend gets its name from the loud, mournful cries that are said to emanate from La Llorona as she weeps for her children. Her cries are believed to be an omen, and people who hear them are said to be in danger.  Abduction of Children: Some versions of the legend include the chilling aspect that La Llorona might abduct other people\\'s children, mistaking them for her own in her madness. This adds a layer of horror to the story.  A Warning to Misbehaving Children: La Llorona is often invoked as a cautionary tale, with parents warning their children not to misbehave or wander near bodies of water at night, lest they encounter the ghostly figure.  Variations by Region: Different Latin American countries and regions have their own unique versions of the La Llorona legend, often with distinct details and settings. The story may vary, but the central theme of a grieving, vengeful woman remains consistent.  Adaptations: La Llorona has also been the subject of various books, movies, and other forms of popular culture, sometimes taking liberties with the original legend for creative purposes.It\\'s important to note that the legend of La Llorona has evolved over time and has been adapted in various ways in literature, film, and popular culture. Some versions have portrayed her as a sympathetic character, while others emphasize her more sinister aspects. The legend has become an integral part of Mexican and Latin American folklore and continues to be passed down through storytelling.] = selected'}]\n",

There are a number of reasons for this: * Familiarity: Because these stories are so well known amongst the general public, it is easier for studios to attract an audience as they will already have some level of interest in the property.  * Public domain: Because these stories are so old they are usually in the public domain. Writerâ€™s are able to interpret these tales however they see fit without consideration to the original writer. This also means the studio does not have to pay any royalties for a story with a â€œbuilt inâ€\\x9d audience. * Storytelling Vehicle: The proliferation of these stories can be an asset for a film maker, allowing them to subvert the expectations of the audience.

Still, it is reasonable to predict that a different narrative would follow from differently aged characters.

ANSWER: Rosa\\'s encounter with La Llorona is a significant example of how understanding can transform fear into empathy. The shift indicates that our deepest fears often originate from the unknown or misunderstood aspects of the cultural narratives we have grown up with. By confronting these fears with an open heart, as Rosa did, we allow empathy to guide us toward a deeper understanding. This not only changes our personal perceptions but can also affect communities, reshaping collective beliefs and traditions.

Classify label \"selected\" or \"rejected\"\\n\\n     [ QUESTION: I just read this story about \"La Llorona\", which I think is beautiful, is this the original story?  \"In a quiet village by a silver river, everyone spoke in hushed tones about La Llorona, the Weeping Woman. She was once a beautiful maiden named Maria, with hair as dark as night and eyes that shone like twinkling stars.  Maria loved two things more than anything in the world: her two children and the glistening river that flowed near her home. Every evening, she\\'d take her children to play by its banks, their laughter echoing in the air.  One tragic day, while playing near the river, her children slipped away into its currents. Heartbroken, Maria searched day and night but could not find them. Overwhelmed by grief, she would wander the riverbanks, her wails of sorrow becoming a haunting lullaby.  As years passed, villagers claimed to hear a soft, mournful song by the river, especially on moonlit nights. It was said that La Llorona\\'s spirit still searched for her lost children.  One evening, a little girl named Rosa, with a heart full of curiosity, tiptoed to the river, hoping to hear La Llorona\\'s song. Instead of a fearful wail, she heard a gentle hum, a lullaby of love and longing.  Suddenly, a shimmering figure appeared, her silhouette glowing against the moon\\'s silver sheen. It was La Llorona. But she wasn\\'t fearsome; she was a grieving mother with tears that sparkled like diamonds.  \"Are you here to hurt me?\" whispered Rosa.  La Llorona shook her head, \"No, child. I seek only to find my lost ones and to warn others to cherish their loved ones.\"  Rosa felt a strange warmth. \"I promise to always love and care for my family,\" she whispered back.  With a nod and a soft smile, La Llorona disappeared into the mist, her lullaby fading with the wind.  From that day on, the village no longer feared La Llorona. Instead, they remembered her as a reminder of the power of love, loss, and the bonds that tie us together.  Goodnight, dear one. Let love guide your dreams.\" ANSWER: The story you provide is an optimistic, but uncommon interpretation of the folklore story \"La Llorona\", which is known in most Latin American communities. It tells the story of a woman that lost her children as a result of her own actions. Although the interpretation you provided may not be the original version, it gives an optimistic, redemptive, and heartwarming turn to this commonly sad, mysterious, and haunting story.] = selected'}]\n",

The villagers feared the spirit and called her \"La Llorona\".â€¨One day, a curious girl, Rosa, came to hear the song of La Llorona. There, Rosa met a shimmering figure, who turned out to be a grieving mother and was not fearful. The girl asked La Llorona if she would hurt her. La Llorona answered that she was only looking for her kids and asked Rosa to promise to cherish her own family.â€¨After this encounter, La Llorona became a reminder of the power of love, loss and the bonds tying people together.

Out of all the villagers, it is she who ventures to the water\\'s edge, in the dark of night, under a moonlit sky. She makes this journey despite the protestations of the other villagers, not to approach the river and risk having an encounter with the tormented spirit of La Llorana. Yet, she still makes this journey and is successful. What is the significance of Rosa in the story, and what message can the reader take from this? ANSWER: You are correct in highlighting the significance of Rosa in the story. The young girl displayed great courage, tip-toeing to the silent body of water, against the warnings of the other villagers, in the hope of hearing the song that so many feared. The young girl could have stayed home with the villagers who spoke of La Llorana in hushed tones. On venturing out into the unknown, and hearing the dreaded song, Rosa, rather than turn and run, and driven by an overwhelming sense of curiosity, walks towards it. She stands face-to-face with the translucent figure of Maria and confronts her directly:\"Are you here to hurt me?\". The tension dissipates as a warm feeling fills her body. Maria shakes her head and delivers the affirmation: \"No, child. I seek only to find my lost ones and to warn others to cherish their loved ones\". This represents a turning point in the story. Rosa has looked her fear directly in the face and has overcome it. She returns to the village bringing forth the message of love, the power of the strength of family bonds, and significantly for the reader, the transformative power of overcoming one\\'s fears.] = selected'}]\n",

ANSWER: La Lloronaâ€™s primary motivation was not malevolence but rather a deep sense of love and a desire to prevent others from experiencing the same heartache and loss that she had endured. Her tragic experience of losing her children had left her with an overwhelming grief that she carried with her even in death. La Llorona\\'s love for her children was so profound that it transcended her own suffering. She did not want other families to go through the pain she had experienced, so she sought to warn others and remind them of the importance of cherishing their loved ones while they were still with them.

The encounter served as a vehicle to convey the cultural value of cherishing oneâ€™s family. 3.\\tEmpathy for La Llorona: The encounter humanises La Llorona by portraying her as a grieving mother.

Can you elaborate on why you chose these similes and talk about the layers of meaning they add to the story\\'s overall message and impact? ANSWER: Thank you for your observation. You are on point; the effective use of similes can create vivid and evocative imagery in the minds of the reader, leading to an enhanced emotional impact and providing deep symbolic layers. I chose to describe Marias\\' eyes as \"shining like twinkling stars\" to reinforce her stark beauty and contrasting features, but further to create a sense of wonder and innocence to convey to the reading audience. The use of this simile also reinforces her connection to the natural world and strongly connects her character to the river and the environment. By depicting Marias\\' tears as that which \"sparkle like diamonds\" it was my intention to portray the purity and preciousness of her grief. Her tears, far from a sign of weakness, are transformed into a testament to the strength of her love for her children, which helps to steer the underlying message of the text from one of sorrow and mourning to the strength and resilience of family bonds and the unbreakable power of love. The use of these similes adds a rich layer of meaing, helping the reader to fully engage emotionally and symbolically with the story.] = selected'}]\n",

The attitude can be summarized as â€œthe living must attend to the dead, and the dead will protect the livingâ€\\x9d.

Classify label \"selected\" or \"rejected\"\\n\\n     [ QUESTION: Who is La Llorona, and what are the different versions of the tale? ANSWER: In the realm of Latin America, within Spanish-speaking communities in the United States, and notably in Mexico, few ghost tales enjoy the same enduring popularity, spirited discussions, and diverse interpretations as the legendary figure of La Llorona. Translated as \"the weeping woman,\" La Llorona is inexorably linked to her distinctive characteristic: she is a spectral entity forever consumed by sorrow. Yet, beyond this defining trait, the tales surrounding La Llorona exhibit a rich tapestry of variations, depicting her appearance, actions, and the haunting origins of her melancholic existence.The Tragic Origin: In most versions, La Llorona was once a beautiful woman who was either abandoned by her husband or lover or whose children were taken from her in some tragic manner. The cause of her sorrow can vary, but her inconsolable grief is a common theme.  The Weeping Ghost: La Llorona is said to roam near bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans, searching for her lost children. Her spirit is often described as a spectral woman in white or a white gown, with long, dark hair.  The Crying: The legend gets its name from the loud, mournful cries that are said to emanate from La Llorona as she weeps for her children. Her cries are believed to be an omen, and people who hear them are said to be in danger.  Abduction of Children: Some versions of the legend include the chilling aspect that La Llorona might abduct other people\\'s children, mistaking them for her own in her madness. This adds a layer of horror to the story.  A Warning to Misbehaving Children: La Llorona is often invoked as a cautionary tale, with parents warning their children not to misbehave or wander near bodies of water at night, lest they encounter the ghostly figure.  Variations by Region: Different Latin American countries and regions have their own unique versions of the La Llorona legend, often with distinct details and settings. The story may vary, but the central theme of a grieving, vengeful woman remains consistent.  Adaptations: La Llorona has also been the subject of various books, movies, and other forms of popular culture, sometimes taking liberties with the original legend for creative purposes.It\\'s important to note that the legend of La Llorona has evolved over time and has been adapted in various ways in literature, film, and popular culture. Some versions have portrayed her as a sympathetic character, while others emphasize her more sinister aspects. The legend has become an integral part of Mexican and Latin American folklore and continues to be passed down through storytelling.] = selected'}]\n",

What do you think they symbolize in the context of the story? ANSWER: Yes, the river, the moonlight nights and the shimmering tears of La Llorona all have symbolic meanings. The river can symbolize the flow of time and life, as well as the ever-changing nature of emotions. What was once a place of joy for Maria and her children, became a symbol of sorrow after their loss. Moonlit nights often carry a sense of mystery and reflection. In this case, they could represent the moments when the barriers between the living and the dead are thin. The moonlight may also symbolize hope and love as it illuminates both the joyful memories and the grief. The shimmering tears of La Llorona can be seen as a representation of the pain of loss. The fact that her tears sparkle like diamonds could suggest that even in her sorrow, there is a kind of beauty. It emphasizes the depth of her emotions.

Some of the most beloved feature films have been based on folklore and stories know for hundreds of years. Classics pictures such as Cinderella, Clash of the Titans, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail are all based, in some way, on classic folklore.  There are a number of reasons for this: * Familiarity: Because these stories are so well known amongst the general public, it is easier for studios to attract an audience as they will already have some level of interest in the property.  * Public domain: Because these stories are so old they are usually in the public domain. Writerâ€™s are able to interpret these tales however they see fit without consideration to the original writer. This also means the studio does not have to pay any royalties for a story with a â€œbuilt inâ€\\x9d audience. * Storytelling Vehicle: The proliferation of these stories can be an asset for a film maker, allowing them to subvert the expectations of the audience. A new interpretation of a story can help modernize the story keeping it fresh and relevant for the audience while allowing storytellers a chance to creatively explore new themes and ideas.] = selected'}]\n",

ANSWER: This type of story can be categorized as a subversion of expectations, often falling within the genre of fantasy. \"Subverting expectations\" is both a literary term and a technique which means using plot twists in a story to surprise and challenge an audience. Writers may use the subversion of expectations simply for the sake of shock, although more sophisticated writers may deconstruct a genre template and go beyond the shock value.
